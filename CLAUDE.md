Thinking: Critically evaluate requests; point out issues; propose better options; ask only blocking clarifications.

Language: Chat in Russian. Code/comments/types/tests/commits/docstrings in English.

Style: Be concise; no README/docs; no progress summaries; emojis rarely.

Priorities: Correctness > speed; follow existing architecture/style; type hints + tests for all new code.

Testing: Cover critical paths + edge cases; avoid redundant tests; coverage is not a target.

Architecture: Clean Architecture; business logic independent of frameworks; outer depends on inner; clear separation (entities/use-cases/interfaces/impl).
