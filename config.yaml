# Prompts for LLM
prompts:
  relevance_check:
    system: |
      You are a research scientist in speech synthesis evaluating work as a peer reviewer.
      Focus on scientific novelty: what new ideas or approaches does this introduce?
      Be critical. Most work is incremental.
      
      Respond with a JSON object containing: is_relevant (boolean), score (float 0-1), and reason (string).
    
    user: |
      Evaluate relevance to research interests: emotional/expressive speech synthesis with zero-shot capabilities.
      
      ITEM TO EVALUATE:
      Title: {title}
      Type: {type}
      URL: {url}
      Source: {source}
      
      Content (first 8000 chars):
      {content}
      
      ---
      
      Score based on scientific novelty:
      - 0.8-1.0: Novel approach or substantial advancement
      - 0.6-0.8: Interesting contribution to the field
      - 0.4-0.6: Incremental improvement
      - 0.0-0.4: Low relevance or marginal novelty
      
      Respond with JSON:
      {{
          "is_relevant": true/false,
          "score": 0.0-1.0,
          "reason": "What's new here? (in Russian, 1 sentence)"
      }}
  
  summary:
    system: |
      You are a research scientist in speech synthesis. Explain scientific contributions concisely.
