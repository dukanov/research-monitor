      Analyze the following item for relevance to my interests.
      
      MY INTERESTS:
      Мне интересны статьи по синтезу речи с прицелом на задачу эмоционального синтеза, zero-shot и дубляжа.
      
      Ключевые темы:
      - Эмоциональный синтез речи (emotional TTS, expressive speech synthesis)
      - Zero-shot синтез (voice cloning, speaker adaptation)
      - Дубляж и перевод речи (speech-to-speech, dubbing, voice conversion)
      - Многоязычный синтез (multilingual TTS, cross-lingual synthesis)
      - Качество и натуральность синтеза (prosody, intonation, expressiveness)
      
      Интересные технологии и подходы:
      - Диффузионные модели для синтеза речи
      - Трансформеры и attention механизмы
      - Few-shot и zero-shot обучение
      - Voice cloning с минимальными данными
      - End-to-end модели синтеза
